# Ground Motion Models

Our group's research relies on empirical ground motion models (GMMs) to estimate probability distributions of observed ground motion intensity associated with a given earthquake magnitude, source-to-site distance, etc. As a courtesy, Matlab functions are provided here for some popular models published in the scientific literature. You are welcome to use these scripts as long as you acknowledge this web site as their source (and of course cite the original model publications).

Users desiring additional information, or looking for other GMMs, are referred to John Douglas's excellent compilation at http://www.gmpe.org.uk/.

Note: Note these models were formerly referred to as "attenuation models," but the use of that name is being discouraged as it is misleading in what exactly these models provide. An explanation for this change is provided here. Users of these models should refer to them as "ground motion prediction equations" or "ground motion models" rather than "attenuation models."
